## FNX Tokenomics Update

### FinNexus’ new community-oriented FNX distribution plan

After completing our [ICTO](https://medium.com/finnexus/deciphering-the-finnexus-token-offering-model-the-icto-6029dbe02610) on [Bitrue](http://bitrue.com/), we released the FNX token distribution plan [here](https://medium.com/finnexus/fnx-tokenomics-62c582807219) and [here](https://medium.com/finnexus/a-note-on-fnx-circulating-supply-7820d668224f). In the past few months we received some valuable suggestions and feedback from the community. We’ve listened to your feedback, and we’re making a few changes based on it.

The changes are outlined below, and we believe they will be beneficial to FNX token holders and the entire FinNexus ecosystem.

## What Changes are Coming to FNX Distribution?

 1. **Establishing community reserves:
**70% of the maximum supply of FNX tokens (approx. 74.5% of our current total supply due to token burns associated with the initial offering) will be reserved to incentivize liquidity and as a fund for the future FinNexus DAO treasury. Our transition to a fully decentralized structure was highlighted in our [initial whitepaper](https://finnexus.github.io/Pdfs/FinNexus_Whitepaper_en.pdf) and remains on track for 2024. We believe it is important to establish a “long tail” of token distribution before moving to a DAO. This token bucket will be used to facilitate that distribution.

 2. **Reducing team & investor’s share to benefit public holders:**
The founding investors and team members have agreed to decrease their own FNX allocation and distribute more to the public.

 3. **Establishing an insurance fund:
**As protection against potential black swan events and other unexpected losses, we are establishing an FNX insurance pool.

 4. **Decreasing operation reserve:**
As FinNexus plans to gradually migrate to DAO governance, the operation reserves for marketing expenses, gas fees, salaries, etc. will be largely decreased and added to the DAO treasury.

 5. **Strengthening token value:**
Reserves for future token sales have also been decreased, in order to have less dilution of the current FNX token value, while still allowing for future potential partnerships and institutional investments.

## New Distribution Plan

As stated [before](https://medium.com/finnexus/finnexus-moves-part-of-fnx-token-supply-to-ethereum-e21be8398db7), the FNX tokens exist in both ERC20 and WRC20 form, and they share the same distribution plan as below:

*(Please note that on 21st August 2020, FinNexus moved 1 million $FNX from the Community Rewards Fund (Mining Incentives & DAO) to the Uniswap mining smart contract address, in the mining pool, as stated [here](https://medium.com/finnexus/introducing-fnx-liquidity-mining-rewards-on-uniswap-24493fbe49d8).)*

We will update the [FNX Token Dashboard ](http://fnx.finnexus.io)accordingly.

## Potential FNX Circulation in Three Years:

* *Given that Uniswap liquidity incentives will last for 1 year with 3.6m $FNX as incentive, and*

* *Given that FPO liquidity incentives will last for 3 years with 9.6m $FNX / year*

We anticipate the evolution of the FNX token supply to look like the following:

![Potential FNX Circulation in 3 Years](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2584/1*a5FbB054p2CMHFCQBcrHxg.png)

At the end of this theoretical 3-year period, the circulating supply would be less than 90m, or 18% of the maximum $FNX supply.

## Community-Oriented FNX Distribution Summary

 1. Maintain the previously announced growth in circulating supply.

 2. Greatly decrease the allocation to team and founding investors.

 3. Establish an ecosystem fund.

 4. Establish an insurance fund.

 5. Decrease the operational reserves and future token sale reserves.

 6. Decrease the circulating supply on the market 3 years hence quite significantly compared with [the previous plan](https://medium.com/finnexus/a-note-on-fnx-circulating-supply-7820d668224f) for FNX token distribution.

## Conclusion

We believe the new FNX token distribution plan benefits the whole FinNexus ecosystem and all current FNX token holders. As always, you can reference our [dashboard](http://fnx.finnexus.io/) for the most up to date info about the FNX token.
